### Hello, I'm Hugo Honda

Hands on and always learning. I'm a full-stack professional, with background in ML, AI and Software Engineering. In the past, I've successfully held leaderships roles like Head of Machine Learning and Startup CTO. Passionate about using data and models to solve complex problems, craft insights, advise leaders, and shape company strategy - a result of my experience within both startups and large corporations. I have navigated company acquisitions and completed successful exits.
